## Introduction
Ever wanted to jump into a new frame, but not sure how? In this article you'll find a straightforward jumping off point for every frame in the game at LL3 and LL6. Each LL6 build is designed to be able to be achieved by the LL3 build through the default Reallocating Points rules in the Core Rulebook at each level up. 

These two points should give you a good picture of how to build each frame, and leave open further expression at later levels. The LL3 and 6 builds for each build will be optimal or near to it for each frame, in my opinion, but with a slant towards general applicability and a simpler gameplan. There are still some complicated builds contained here, but you'll be able to take any of them into any party or mission type and have plenty of capacity to perform well.  

After each frame, you'll find a short description of the build, with some suggested strategies and play patterns.  

Use the table of contents or Control-F to help you navigate by manufacturer to your frame of choice.

A veritable toolbox of control options, with a powerful suite of weapons for Skirmishing (Assault Cannon) and defending yourself (Impaler Nailgun). Use Blink Charges as grenades and the Prospector talent to move your team vast distances. 

I wrote a much more extensive guide on Chomolungma, all the way from LL0 to 12 [here](https://majinevelyn.com/docs/Lancer/Electronic%20Assault%20-%20Chomolungma.html).

```
A straightforward take on the classic build, Asura HMG Everest. On your "Nova" turns, with Asura, Initiative, and Overcharge, you can shoot your Heavy Machine Gun four times. Make use of Tactician 3's flank to finish off targets and move yourself even more with Skirmisher 2.  If you're close enough, you can even use your Fuel Rod Gun with flank instead to clear some heat.

```
A brick wall, with solid off-turn pressure that retains some damage potential. You have a solid Skirmish with Overpower Caliber'd Legionnaire Battle Rifle. Heavy Gunner with Flash Charges can heavily lock down a few targets, as in order to get back their line of sight, they'll have to move in a way that triggers Heavy Gunner. LBR's knockback can push them back into the Flash Charge zone. Use Crack Shot when you don't need to move, Blink Charges when you do, and Brace once per scene when you get threatened.

[ SYSTEMS ]

```
Your typical turn plan is as follows:
- Barrage starting with War Pike, from up to range 5
- Free Action Grapple from Duelist 3
- You're pulled adjacent to the target
- End Barrage with Nanocarbon Sword, with Accuracy from Pankrati 1
Use Pankrati 2 to get into range for this Barrage, Vanguard 3 DSAS for off-turn pressure, and Emergency Repair Module when you get sufficiently threatened.

```
In order to reliably make use of Argonaut Shield, this build uses Prospector 3 along with Warp Grenades and Skirmisher 2 to move itself and allies forward, and stay close to them. While your Core Active is in use, Bracing with Emergency Repair Module is even more powerful an option.

```
The grappling demon itself, Empakaai. On each turn, Barrage your Collossus Termo-Unguis, utilizing Backswing Cut and No Escape to brutalize and Grapple as many enemies as you can. Then, with Pankrati 1 and Brawler 1, your UNCLE-Class Comp/Con'd Kinetic Hammer will attack without inaccuracy against grappled targets as a free action. Beware, you will likely draw much ire from your GM, as this is a notoriously powerful frame and build.

```
A classic Support/Controller, you will be aiming to build up 5 Jolly Roger Charges for Swindle every combat. Therefore, most turns will involve placing one of your available deployables, then using a tech action on an ally. At LL6, you can accomplish this by deploying a Utility Drone, then targeting it with Logic Bomb from Viral Logic Suite. This forces the enemies to make the save against Slowed with difficulty.

8 Sensors might not seem like much to hack with, but with speed 6 you should often have targets available to use Eject Power Cores on. Use your Assault Cannon to finish off low targets, and use your other available systems to support your team. Avoid using Latch Drone, it's almost never worth the action cost.

```
With Blinkspace Tunneler, Spaceborn 1, and Overcharge, you can get into Danger Zone on round 1 guaranteed. By Boosting and then Skirmishing on that turn, you'll move 19 Spaces without Core Active, and 25 Spaces with it (As well as hitting one target very hard). Blinkspace Tunneler lets your allies follow you wherever you've gone at the end of that turn, but I don't recommend using it after round 1, as enemies can use it to follow you too. Outside of this rollout, you're a very mobile and versatile Striker that's very hard to pin down with Vanguard 3 and Skirmisher 2 along with your Skirmisher frame trait.

Missile Racks are easy to utilize for this Gunslinger Raleigh, as they are longer range than Hand Cannons and can easily trigger Gunslinger 3 every turn. Make sure you use the Integrated Nexus (Light) for Gunslinger 2, and for hitting low E-Defense targets very hard with Gunslinger 3. On your Full Metal Jacket Turn, use Heavy Gunner 3 and Scylla to shoot your Legionnaire Battle Rifle with your Reactions.

One of the highest damage output Strikers, Störtebeker's typical turn plan is as follows:
- Barrage Chain Axe and (Bolt Thrower/Cannibal) on Round 1 to unload your ranged Heavy weapon
- On subsequent rounds, Skirmish Chain Axe, hopefully critting (or using Truesilver/Overcharge if you don't)
- Reprisal with your Heavy Ranged Weapon, getting another Skirmisher 2 trigger
The Hand Cannons are mostly there as Overwatch weapons, but they can be destroyed first if you get Weapons Down as a Structure Damage result twice.

A flying toolbox controller/support with a few unique tools, namely sharing your line of sight and Sensors with Relay Coupling. The simplest way we can achieve that is by using Type-3 Projected Shield on an ally as a protocol, but Shahnameh or Puppet Systems will also do it. With your speed and flight, you can extend the effective range of your allies across a large portion of the map. 

Aside from this powerful gimmick, we also have in-built Anti-Invisibility features and a strong set of other general tools in our toolbox. Tactician 2 lets us weaponize our flight even harder by making our Assault Cannon shoot with Accuracy, when the situation calls for damage.

Tom Bloom's favorite mech, the Tortuga is one of the best at Skirmishing along with Hacking. It has one of the best off-turn pressure toolkits in the game thanks to Sentinel and its Core Power. Vanguard 3 DSAS is what is usually thought of for Tortuga's off-turn pressure, but Tactician 3 with Heavy Machine Gun is often even more powerful. Aside from this, we have strong movement thanks to Blink Charges (which you can get extra value out of as a Size 2 mech), Prospector, and Skirmisher 2. Flash Charges can be used when you Immobilize targets while your Core Active is in use.

The complexity in this build comes from tracking Xiaoli's Ingenuity charges and using them to damage enemies with terrain. Otherwise, your plan is simple and effective - get in, Barrage with your TCB, and Overwatch anyone that approaches with your DSAS.

Between your innate evasion and Flash Anchor, you'll be hard to pin down.

These NPCs generally have high E-Defense, so we'll choose Tweaked Optics and Stripped Reactor Shielding for our Engineer 2 options, as we don't want to make our Prototype Weapon Smart.

Emperor is all about the Arcbow, and leveraging your Controller stats. Tactician 3 doesn't halve the overshield you apply or the damage/overshield from your Core Active. Typical turns involve an Arcbow Skirmish plus an Invade, another control action, or Shahnameh. Don't forget to use Skirmisher 2 to get the best Arcbow Line angles you can.

Metalmark is quite the generic striker, but this build deviates from that a bit by leveraging its decent Sensors.

Most of your turns will include a Gandiva Skirmish and an Invade, but at LL6 you'll have a few more tools. Eye of a HORUS defeats a number of pesky NPCs (don't forget it lasts 2 rounds effectively), and Heavy Gunner + Flash Charges provide some powerful control. Heavy Gunner requires Line of Sight for the Covering Fire Quick Action, but the following Reaction attack does not. Since Gandiva Missiles have Seeking, you can run behind cover after you've applied Covering Fire, and still shoot around the cover if the targets try to move.

When you're able, stand still and deliver Lock Ons while Invisible, as close to allies as you can for Spotter usage with your Autopod. When you can't, use Prospector and Blink Charges to get you and your team to a viable spot for you. Fill the rest with H0R_OS I invades and drone support.

With Heatfall Coolant System, you can easily Overcharge to Skirmish most turns, either using Redundant Systems Upgrade to clear all Heat along with a second Skirmish, or Barraging with Fuel Rod Gun to clear 4 Heat.

Every turn, you want to land an Invade to get a Void Husk onto the field. At minimum, they're very helpful for applying Slow to enemies across the battlefield. Using Puppet Systems when adjacent to an enemy will let you Overwatch them with your Main Melee, Shredding them with Void Husks. Turret Drones are good targets for your Core Active to banish an enemy from the map.

Likely the most complicated frame and build on the list. There's a lot you can do with Soul Vessel and Chronostutter, but they'll augment your core tools: H0R_OS I invades, Turret Drones, Prospector, and your weapons (Unraveler at LL3 and Impaler Nailgun at LL6). Even if you only use Soul Vessel to negate your Overcharge Heat every turn, this build will perform very well. However, Soul Vessel can be used to deny a lot of offensive action from enemies, and with Prospector you can return right back where you intended to be. 

Chronostutter makes things even more complicated, but similarly can be used as a defensive tool to deny your enemies' offense. Leader 2 and Type-3 Projected Shield can both be used on allies and then Chronostutter'd as a form of low cost movement on- and off-turn.

This variety of Lycan cares little for its Core Active. Instead, it devotes build space for Control with Impaler Nailgun with Power Flux, H0R_OS I and Smite invades, and movement support with Prospector and Blink Charges. We still have Executioner 1 for when you must use Shock Claws, perhaps towards the end of a sitrep to secure objectives.

Minotaur has a few gimmicks with Metafold Maze, both of which are empowered by one specific ally, a Taraxacum giving you Relay Coupling to extend your effective Sensors. With 8 Sensors, it can sometimes be difficult to achieve your gameplan alone, but you can still be reasonably effective without this help from a teammate. 

Logic Bomb from Viral Logic Suite allows you to apply Metafold Maze to all of the surrounding targets that fail the save, meaning you can immediately apply Immobilize, or even Stunned if any of them are already Immobilized. Keep in mind that you can use Logic Bomb on allies, including drones, which will automatically hit the ally and not harm them in any way, while still applying the Slow to the surrounding enemies. If any allies place Drones such as Utility Drones, this combo is particularly effective.

At LL5 and beyond, you get another combo with Metafold Maze with Impaler Nailgun. 
- Use Puppet Systems on an enemy in a way that triggers your Impaler Nailgun Overwatch with Vanguard 3
- If the enemy fails the Hull save against Immobilize, you can Metafold Maze, Stunning them.
This Stun only works once per scene against each enemy, and uses two quick actions to disable one enemy, but it’s a solid tool in your arsenal to use.

This build will almost always want to shoot the Siege Cannon in Direct Fire mode, which is generally the more useful profile as it doesn't require reloading and has half the heat cost. 

While Barbarossa may seem like a slow frame at first glance, being Size 3 and having a high Heat Cap actually make this a non issue with smart play and a few specific build choices. Ace 2 plus Rapid Burst Jump Jets means you move very far on any Boost, at the cost of some Heat. Later, you can use Blink Charges to move 7-9 spaces at a time by only including one of your hexes on each edge. Movement tools like this are excellent, because it lets you take advantage of Heavy Frame to hold an area very well. 

Generally, be very judicious with using Apocalypse Rail. It will turn off all of your movement tools, and the payoff isn't necessarily worth it - it's not Accurate like your Siege Cannon. Consider it more heavily on sitreps like Holdout or Control.

Despite appearances, Enkidu is a Controller. With Type-3 Projected Shield, Spaceborn 1, and Overcharge, you're guaranteed to get into Danger Zone on round 1 at LL3. At LL6, you can Skirmish with Annihilator to guarantee Danger Zone. Interdiction Field prevents enemy teleportation, and applies slowed to enemies in the same range as your Plasma Talons. If they fail the save, your Talons will have Accuracy against them, and they'll have an even harder time getting away from your glue trap. 

On-turn, Skirmish with your War Pike, and use Hunter 3 to throw your Plasma Talons as a free action.

With Supermassive Mod, you can immediately knock enemies back into the flames you create with the weapon. Use AGNI and Fuel Rod Gun to keep from stressing, but Superior By Design will protect you from a common Stress result.

A bulky and annoying generalist, you have a few good proactive tools to get you by before your reactive ones. Heavy Gunner with LBR is quite powerful on its own, especially so in combination with Flash Charges, threatening to essentially turn off NPCs without teleportation or other reaction-avoiding movement. With Overpower Caliber, your Skirmish with LBR is also quite solid, even more so if you can afford to Immobilize yourself with Crack Shot for Accuracy. Turret Drones are solid as always. All of these tools build towards your Locked and Loaded feature, giving you extra offensive and defensive capabilities.

Between your Core Active, Core Passive, and Emergency Repair Module with Reactive Weave for a very powerful Brace, you'll be very difficult to kill. Just be mindful when you use that last tool, as the downsides for Bracing can sometimes outweigh the benefits even with these systems.

While Iskander does have Mine traits, this build won't use them. Your Blink Charges will be much better used as Warp Grenades, which can be thrown up to range 15 because of Assault Launcher. Aside from taking advantage of this, you have some standard straightforward tools to accompany your good stats: Skirmishing HMG, H0R_OS I invades, Turret Drones, and Impaler Nailgun.

Type-3 Projected Shield will trigger your Shield trait without a save, which can be very powerful.

With a narrow focus on Control, this Sunzi debilitates enemies in a number of different ranges and in a few unique ways. Teleportation, like from Blink Charges, can be redirected to your Blink Anchor or to yourself for allies. With the extra charges of Blink Anchor from Integrated Ammo Feeds, you'll be able to continuously keep enemies trapped where you want them. If you put down a Wandering Nightmare on top of your Blink Anchor (best achieved on the first round of the Sitrep with an Overcharge), they'll risk being Slowed, making it even harder to get anywhere meaningful. Don't forget to utilize Demolitionist 3 and Safe Harbor to get extra value out of Warp Grenades.

This build, and any Tagetes build that wants to take advantage of Tagetes' Fusiller trait, will benefit greatly from allies with movement support tools. While your Tachyon Lance is range 20, you will still inevitably need to spend some time getting into position, especially to make use of Crack Shot. This will be a bit less of a concern at LL6 once you get Nanocomposite Adaptation for your Tachyon Lance, but some movement will very likely be necessary in any sufficiently difficult combat. 

Those considerations aside, your gameplan is simple - Barrage your Tachyon Lance at the highest priority targets every turn possible. You can spend 2-3 turns doing this without Stressing, and then clear off the Heat with Redundant Systems Upgrade or a normal Stabilize before going back to shooting.

Despite appearances, Tokugawa's damage trait applies to ranged weapons as well. Smartgun is an easy choice, letting you attack from very far away and behind cover at Accuracy. Depending on how safe your positioning is, you can just Barrage both Smartguns and stay Exposed, or Stabilize with either an RSU charge or a normal Stabilize accompanied with an Overcharge to clear your Exposed and Heat.

As a treat, Tokugawa gets a second LL6 variant for a melee build. This really starts functioning at LL4 with Catalytic Hammer, which is unfortunate for the format of this article. In any case, your goal is simple - get close with Pankrati 2, Prospector, and Skirmisher, then start Overcharge looping your Catalytic Hammer. More broken down, here's the typical loop:
- Protocol Overclock to become Exposed
- Overcharge, generating 5-10 Heat, guaranteeing Danger Zone
- Use Skirmisher 2 before you attack to get into range if you need to, or after the attack to break engagement
- Skirmish with your Catalytic Hammer, with bonus damage from Nuclear Cavalier 2, Roland Chamber, and Limit Break
- Attack with your Integrated Tactical Knife as a Free Action, with bonus damage from Limit Break
- As a Full Action, Stabilize to Clear Heat and Exposed, and reload your Catalytic Hammer

You can do this loop from Threat 2 without your Core Active or Threat 4 with it. 

If your team has movement support, Grease Monkey 2 instead of Vanguard 1 Prospector 1 can make you quite a bit harder to control.  

## Conclusion
If you have any questions about these builds, feel free to ping me (majinevelyn) on the Hearth-7 discord! 

Now for something a little sillier. If you read through many or all of these builds, you may have noticed some patterns in build choices. As both a joke and self-roast, I've compiled a spreadsheet to show just how common those patterns are. Enjoy!
