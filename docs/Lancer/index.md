## Article Format
We will be following the Core Rulebook's rules for "Reallocating Points," outlined below. In my experience, many tables are less restrictive with "respecs" than these rules describe, but for the sake of this article we will be using these rules to be as helpful to as many players as possible in campaigns.
### REALLOCATING POINTS 
Every time your pilotâ€™s LL increases, you also have the option to choose one: 
- Reallocate all ranks from one of your talents to any other talent. 
- Reallocate all ranks from one of your licenses to any other license. 
- Replace one core bonus with another core bonus for which your pilot qualifies.
If reallocating ranks from one license to another means your pilot no longer qualifies for a core bonus, you must replace that core bonus with one you now qualify for.
